Portfolio test
PLEASE report to me if you've identified innapropriate naming of variables, class, or any element (I may have been frustrated during the design process and just randomly named a variable with an offensive slur)

May contain a lot of useless lines (since I used previous project as the template) The naming might be innaproriate, since (again, I used previous project as the template) Yes, this def will be my template for the real portfolio
